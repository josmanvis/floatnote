<objective>
Configure package.json so that npm publishes only the bin/ directory (~7KB CLI script) and gates publishing on passing tests.

Purpose: The npm package must be minimal (under 10KB) since it is only a CLI launcher that downloads the real app from GitHub Releases. The `main` field currently causes src/main.js to leak into the tarball, violating the size constraint.

Output: A package.json that passes `npm pack --dry-run` verification (bin-only, under 10KB) while keeping `electron .` functional for local development.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Configure package.json for bin-only publishing</name>
  <files>package.json</files>
  <action>
Make three changes to package.json:

1. Remove the `"main": "src/main.js"` field entirely. This prevents src/main.js from being included in the npm tarball (npm always includes the main entry regardless of the files whitelist).

2. Add `"files": ["bin/"]` at the top level. This restricts the published tarball to only bin/ contents (plus always-included package.json, README, LICENSE).

3. Add `"prepublishOnly": "npm test"` to the scripts section. This lifecycle hook runs tests before any npm publish attempt, gating publishing on test passage.

4. Update the `"start"` script from `"electron ."` to `"electron src/main.js"` and the `"dev"` script from `"electron . --enable-logging"` to `"electron src/main.js --enable-logging"`. This is necessary because `electron .` relies on the `main` field in package.json to find the entry point, and we are removing that field. Passing the entry file directly to electron is equivalent and does not require the main field.

Do NOT add any new dependencies. Do NOT modify the bin field, build config, or any other fields.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run these commands and verify:

1. `npm pack --dry-run 2>&1` - Output should show ONLY:
   - bin/floatnote.js
   - package.json
   - (README.md and/or LICENSE if they exist)
   - NO src/ files, NO tests/, NO other directories
   - Total package size should be reported under 10KB

2. `npm run start -- --version 2>&1 || true` - Verify the start script still references electron correctly (may fail if electron not in PATH but command should show `electron src/main.js`)

3. `node -e "const p = require('./package.json'); console.log('files:', p.files); console.log('prepublishOnly:', p.scripts.prepublishOnly); console.log('main:', p.main);"` - Should show files: ["bin/"], prepublishOnly: "npm test", main: undefined
  </verify>
  <done>
npm pack --dry-run shows only bin/floatnote.js and package.json (plus README/LICENSE), total size under 10KB. The prepublishOnly script is set to "npm test". The start/dev scripts use explicit entry point path instead of relying on main field.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify npm test still passes and pack produces correct tarball</name>
  <files>package.json</files>
  <action>
Run the full verification suite to confirm nothing is broken:

1. Run `npm test` to confirm tests still pass (this is what prepublishOnly will execute).

2. Run `npm pack --dry-run` and parse the output to verify:
   - Package size is under 10KB
   - Only expected files are included (bin/floatnote.js, package.json, README.md, LICENSE)
   - No src/, tests/, node_modules/, or other dev files leak in

3. Run `npm pack` to create the actual tarball, then inspect it:
   - `tar tzf floatnote-*.tgz` to list contents
   - Verify only package/bin/floatnote.js and package/package.json (plus README/LICENSE)
   - Delete the .tgz file after verification

4. Verify the bin script still works in isolation:
   - `node bin/floatnote.js --version` should print the version from package.json
   - `node bin/floatnote.js --help` should print usage info

If npm test fails, do NOT proceed - the test failure is a pre-existing issue unrelated to this plan's changes (package.json config only).

If npm pack shows unexpected files, investigate which package.json field is causing the inclusion and fix it.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `npm test` exits with code 0
2. `npm pack --dry-run` shows package size under 10KB and only bin/ files
3. `tar tzf floatnote-*.tgz` shows only package/bin/floatnote.js, package/package.json, and optionally README/LICENSE
4. `node bin/floatnote.js --version` outputs version string
5. The .tgz file is cleaned up after verification
  </verify>
  <done>
Tests pass, tarball contains only the CLI script and metadata files, total package size is under 10KB, and the bin script executes correctly in isolation. The package is ready for npm publish.
  </done>
</task>

- `npm pack --dry-run` output shows only bin/floatnote.js, package.json, and auto-included files
- Package size under 10KB
- `npm test` passes (prepublishOnly gate would succeed)
- `node bin/floatnote.js --version` works correctly
- npm start/dev scripts still reference the correct electron entry point
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. package.json has no `main` field, has `"files": ["bin/"]`, and has `"prepublishOnly": "npm test"` in scripts
2. npm pack --dry-run confirms package size under 10KB with only bin/ contents
3. All existing tests still pass
4. The bin script executes correctly and can read package.json for version info
