# Roadmap: Floatnote v1 (Archived)

## Overview

Floatnote has a working app with no automated quality gates or distribution pipeline. This milestone builds the testing and delivery chain: integration tests verify IPC contracts, E2E tests verify user-facing flows in a real Electron instance, CI/CD automates builds on every push and tag, and npm publishing makes `npx floatnote` the install path. Each phase depends on the previous -- tests must pass before CI is useful, CI must build before releases work, and releases must exist before npm publishing functions.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Integration Tests** - IPC and preload bridge contracts verified with real source code
- [x] **Phase 2: E2E Tests** - Core user flows verified in real Electron app via Playwright
- [x] **Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing, building, and releasing on GitHub Actions
- [x] **Phase 4: npm Publishing** - CLI-only package published to npm, downloads app from Releases
- [x] **Phase 5: Layers and Layer Management** - Modern minimal layer system for organizing drawing elements

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Integration Tests
**Goal**: IPC communication contracts between main, preload, and renderer are verified against real source code
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02
**Plans:** 2 plans (01-01, 01-02)
**Completed:** 2026-01-22

### Phase 2: E2E Tests
**Goal**: Core user-facing flows work end-to-end in a real Electron app instance
**Requirements**: TEST-03, TEST-04, TEST-05, TEST-06, TEST-07, TEST-08
**Plans:** 3 plans (02-01, 02-02, 02-03)
**Completed:** 2026-01-23

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Every push runs tests automatically, and version tags produce signed GitHub Releases with macOS artifacts
**Requirements**: CICD-01, CICD-02, CICD-03, CICD-04, CICD-05, CICD-06
**Plans:** 2 plans (03-01, 03-02)
**Completed:** 2026-01-23

### Phase 4: npm Publishing
**Goal**: `npx floatnote` installs a minimal CLI package from npm that downloads and launches the app from GitHub Releases
**Requirements**: NPM-01, NPM-02, NPM-03, NPM-04, NPM-05
**Plans:** 2 plans (04-01, 04-02)
**Completed:** 2026-01-23

### Phase 5: Layers and Layer Management
**Goal**: Modern, minimal layer system allowing users to organize shapes, drawings, and text into layers with visibility, reordering, and grouping
**Requirements**: User-requested feature
**Plans:** 2 plans (05-01, 05-02)
**Completed:** 2026-01-23

## Statistics
